# Digital-Clock-with-in-Python
This is a simple task to get started with the Tkinter library in Python, which is a built-in package that comes with Python. Tkinter has some cool features that can be used to build simple apps.
Now let’s see how to create a digital clock GUI application with Python. I will first start with importing the libraries:
Now let’s define the title and size of our application. Note that in the code below I will set both the height and width of the resizable function as True(1,1) if you want a fixed window and don’t want to maximize or minimize the output you can set it to False(0,0):
Now here I will define the font of the time and its colour, its border width and the background colour of the digital clock:
Now here I will combine all the elements to define the label of the clock application:
Now let’s define the main function of our digital clock. Here I will set the text of the label as the realtime:
let’s run and see our output:
